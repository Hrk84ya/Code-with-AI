# Code with AI
Welcome to Code with AI! This repository contains various code snippets, projects, and examples that have been generated with the help of Artificial Intelligence. The goal of this repo is to showcase the potential of AI-assisted coding and provide users with useful templates, solutions, and learning resources generated by AI tools.

## Introduction
Code with AI is a collection of code samples, small projects, and solutions generated using AI-powered tools, such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT models. These projects aim to demonstrate the ability of AI to assist in generating functional and optimized code for various programming languages, frameworks, and tasks.

This repository is perfect for:
* Developers looking for code snippets or templates.
* AI enthusiasts wanting to explore the capabilities of code generation tools.
* Anyone interested in learning how AI can be used in the software development process.

## Getting Started
To get started with the code in this repository, you will need:
* A working installation of the appropriate programming environment for each project (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java, etc.).
* (Optional) Access to the required AI tools or APIs used for code generation. Some projects might require API keys or configurations for accessing AI services.

Clone this repository to your local machine to start exploring the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hrk84ya/Code-with-AI.git
cd Code-with-AI
```
## AI Tools Used
This repository leverages multiple AI tools and models for code generation. Some of the primary tools include:

* OpenAI GPT Models: These models were used to generate code snippets, algorithms, and even entire projects based on natural language prompts.
* GitHub Copilot: GitHub Copilot helped in generating boilerplate code and suggesting improvements for various coding problems.
* Tabnine: Tabnine was used to enhance code completion and provide contextual suggestions while writing more complex code.
* Other AI Tools: Various AI-driven tools for code refactoring, bug detection, and optimization were used depending on the project.
